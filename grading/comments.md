Hello ,
Thank you for submitting your homework assignment! You presented a notebook pulling in the school data csv. This is a great start!
You were able to output the district summary with correct data! Unfortunately, there were some mistakes while utilizing the groupby function. I would recommend reviewing previous classwork that utilizes the groupby function.
You are on the right path! Please try to utilize office hours, tutoring and learning assistance on a regular basis. Tasha, do not get discouraged, this is the beginning of the journey, things will come together and click!

Hello studentName,

Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! You were able to deliver on the establishment of your queries to retrieve the climate data from the measurements table. Well done with your summary as well! 

The temperatures were also added to the list which was then properly converted to a DataFrame. studentName well done creating a query that only collects data from the last year of data. You were also able to save the results to a DataFrame and plot them using the "plot" method. Your station analysis was excellent, you were able to find the number of stations, the most active station and create a query to find the tobs for the most active station, well done.

Now, studentName, I have to say how impressed with your code formatting, you placed your imports at the top, named variables with standard conventions, and wrote concise comments! Keep up the amazing work and this awesome flow you have been able to establish!
