#### Jupyter Notebook Database Connection (10 points)
- [ ] Use the SQLAlchemy `create_engine()` function to connect to your SQLite database (1 point)
- [ ] Use the SQLAlchemy `automap_base()` function to reflect your tables into classes (3 points)
- [ ] Save references to the classes named `station` and `measurement` (4 points)
- [ ] Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session (1 point)
- [ ] Close your session at the end of your notebook (1 point)
#### Precipitation Analysis (16 points)
- [ ] Create a query that finds the most recent date in the dataset (8/23/2017) (2 points)
- [ ] Create a query that collects only the `date` and `precipitation` for the last year of data without passing the date as a variable (4 points)
- [ ] Save the query results to a Pandas DataFrame to create `date` and `precipitation` columns (2 points)
- [ ] Sort the DataFrame by `date` (2 points)
- [ ] Plot the results by using the DataFrame `plot` method with `date` as the x and `precipitation` as the y variables (4 points)
- [ ] Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data (2 points)
#### Station Analysis (16 points)
- [ ] Design a query that correctly finds the number of stations in the dataset (9) (2 points)
- [ ] Design a query that correctly lists the stations and observation counts in descending order and finds the most active station (USC00519281) (2 points)
- [ ] Design a query that correctly finds the min, max, and average temperatures for the most active station (USC00519281) (3 points)
- [ ] Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data that filters by the station that has the greatest number of observations (3 points)
- [ ] Save the query results to a Pandas DataFrame (2 points)
- [ ] Correctly plot a histogram with `bins=12` for the last year of data using `tobs` as the column to count. (4 points)
#### API SQLite Connection & Landing Page (10 points)
- [ ] Correctly generate the engine to the correct sqlite file (2 points)
- [ ] Use `automap_base()` and reflect the database schema (2 points)
- [ ] Correctly save references to the tables in the sqlite file (`measurement` and `station`) (2 points)
- [ ] Correctly create and binds the session between the python app and database (2 points)
- [ ] Display the available routes on the landing page (2 points)
#### API Static Routes (15 points)
##### A **precipitation route** that:
- [ ] Returns json with the date as the key and the value as the precipitation (3 points)
- [ ] Only returns the jsonified precipitation data for the last year in the database (3 points)
##### A **stations route** that:
- [ ] Returns jsonified data of all of the stations in the database (3 points)
##### A **tobs route** that:
- [ ] Returns jsonified data for the most active station (USC00519281) (3 points)
- [ ] Only returns the jsonified data for the last year of data (3 points)
#### API Dynamic Route (15 points)
##### A **start route** that:
- [ ] Accepts the start date as a parameter from the URL (2 points)
- [ ] Returns the min, max, and average temperatures calculated from the given start date to the end of the dataset (4 points)
##### A **start/end route** that:
- [ ] Accepts the start and end dates as parameters from the URL (3 points)
- [ ] Returns the min, max, and average temperatures calculated from the given start date to the given end date (6 points)
#### Coding Conventions and Formatting (8 points)
- [ ] Place imports at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants. (2 points)
- [ ] Name functions and variables with lowercase characters, with words separated by underscores. (2 points)
- [ ] Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, creating maintainable and reusable code. (2 points)
- [ ] Use concise logic and creative engineering where possible. (2 points)
#### Deployment and Submission (6 points)
- [ ] Submit a link to a GitHub repository thatâ€™s cloned to your local machine and contains your files. (2 points)
- [ ] Use the command line to add your files to the repository. (2 points)
- [ ] Include appropriate commit messages in your files. (2 points)
#### Comments (4 points)
- [ ] Be well commented with concise, relevant notes that other developers can understand. (4 points)
