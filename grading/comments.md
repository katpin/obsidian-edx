Hello studentName,

Congratulations on a good homework assignment! You were able to demonstrate your ability to use VBA code to loop through the sheets correctly! Your calculation of total stock analysis was correct. Unfortunately, when creating the list of tickers, they were created on the same line as the original list of tickers rather than sequential rows.

This was a good start to your 24 week journey studentName, keep up the good work and this amazing flow you have been able to establish!
